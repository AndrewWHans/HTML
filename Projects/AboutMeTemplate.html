	  <p>I am an enrolled student undergraduate at <abbr title = "Indiana University of South Bend">IU South Bend.</abbr> My major currently is informatics, with a cognate in Psychology.<br />
		 One of my biggest philosophies I go by is the idea that <b>curiosity being a key to passionate learning.</b><br />
	     With my curiosity of the digital age, I inevitably will continuously want more to learn about the computer world.<br />
	     Currently I'm self-studying programming languages, including: HTML, CSS, and C++<br />
	     As I am working on new skills, I am continuously improving my acquired knowledge of Java and Python<br />

	     with hopes of being able to add to the vision of technology.</p>
