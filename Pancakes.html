   <h1>Making: Delicious Fluffy Pancakes</h2>
   <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
     <li>2 cups plain flour</li>
     <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar or sweetener</li>
     <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
     <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
     <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
     <li>1 3/4 cup of milk</li>
     <li>1/4 cup of butter</li>
     <li>2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract</li>
     <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. After combining, add milk, melted butter, vanilla and egg.</li>
     <li>Use a whisk to whisk the ingredients together before slowly folding them into the dryer ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay).
	 The batter will be thick and creamy in consistency. If you find the batter too thick, fold a couple tablespoons of extra milk into the batter at a time until desired consistency.</li>

     <li>Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle.</li> 
     <li>Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan. 
         Pour Â¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.</li>
     <li>When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
     <li>Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!</li>
